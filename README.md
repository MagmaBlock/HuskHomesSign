# HuskHomesSign
An addon for HuskHomes that allows players to warp by signs.

## Usage
Install HuskHomes and drop this plugin into your `plugins` directory.

To create a warp sign, you must have the `huskhomessign.create` permission.

Write `[warp]` on the first line and the warp name on the second line to create a warp sign.

Players with the `huskhomessign.use` permission will be able to use the sign to teleport.

By default, player without `huskhomessign.break` permission will not be able to break warp signs.

Use `/huskhomessign reload` to reload the config.yml file, require `huskhomessign.admin`.

## Customization
Messages and sign displays can be customized in the config.yml file.
